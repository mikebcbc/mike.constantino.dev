Over the past few months, I’ve been fine-tuning my workflow with a new dotfiles setup, and it’s completely transformed how I code. From Neovim to experimenting with yabai for floating window management, it's been a journey of optimizing speed and efficiency. I thought I would take the time to write a quick overview of the tools I’m using, how they’ve evolved, and the lessons I’ve picked up along the way. If you’re into any of the tools I mention here, or just curious about my setup, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/mikebcbc/dotfiles).

## Neovim

After falling into the Neovim config hole (which I am certain will never end), it's changed how I move around and thinkg about code pretty fundamentally. Moving around a codebase feels seamless now, and I feel way more organized and in control behind the wheel. One of the most powerful tools I’ve started using more frequently is the **quickfix list**. It's become my go-to for global find/replace tasks, and I often use it as a "to-do" list to keep track of things I need to tackle. Having that level of control has made navigating and managing large codebases much more efficient.

Another key change I made was adjusting how I use AI code completion tools like Copilot or Supermaven. Initially, I relied on automatic suggestions, but I found that constantly having to analyze and correct the AI’s suggestions disrupted my flow. So, I switched to on-demand AI completion, which has been a much better fit for my style. Treating these tools as companions rather than relying on them has given me a smoother, and less disruptive workflow.

## Floating Windows with Yabai
I also started using yabai for window tiling, but I quickly realized a locked-in window layout just wasn’t my thing. Now, I use it to control floating windows, which has been a game changer. It can be a bit laggy since yabai processes all visible window positions since there is no pre-defined layout, but the ability to toggle focus between floating windows is worth it. I also setup commands to set floating windows on a grid so that I still have access to the "layout", just with less restrictions. Paired with skhd, my hands rarely touch the mouse anymore, and I love it.

## Zellij for Session Management
Another big win has been Zellij. While I still use Neovim sessions to save things like editor layout and cursor position, I now pair them with Zellij sessions to handle test commands, server commands, and higher-level multiplexer layout. This combo has been a game changer, allowing me to organize my workspace more effectively. The only downside is that the plugin ecosystem for Zellij is still early – not much to choose from yet. I've been thinking that this would be a good opportunity to dive into Rust and create some quality-of-life plugins myself.

## Wrapping It Up
This journey into refining my workflow with Neovim, yabai, and Zellij has really transformed how I approach coding. Each tool brings its own unique power and flexibility, making my development workflow smoother and more efficient. As I continue to learn and adapt, my setup will no doubt evolve, but these tools have become essential for now.
